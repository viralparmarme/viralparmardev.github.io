                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I have been working as a Software Engineer in the Fintech domain throughout my career. That enables me to understand and contribute to Collctiv at a deeper level beyond just the technical side of things.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I designed and developed a high-performance Customer 360 platform for a top private Indian bank using Angular, Django, and PostgreSQL to eliminate spreadsheet-based tasks, reducing the operation time of relationship managers by 70%. This project involved only 2 developers and communications with many relationship managers to understand their requirements and pain points with the current system.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I have also worked on the complete SDLC for a leading cash management firm, developing an auditing application in Flask. Being a part of the end-to-end process allowed me to optimize latencies across layers, where my team discovered a DB bottleneck due to unoptimized queries. Ultimately the frontend app received data twice as fast as previously possible with the chosen tech stack.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        At one of my previous jobs, I created a full-stack cloud-based application backed by AWS EC2, S3, and RDS for easy payments for a Credit Score company. My first time on a pure Node.js application (with Vanilla JS in the front end) based on the tight requirements of the client. It involved a heavy chunk of time spent on making high quality documentation for everything from API signatures, DB schema, and user journeys.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Speaking of AWS, I have built 18 unique Serverless Microservices leveraging AWS Lambda for large Fintech clients as a banking API Suite. I also became an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and an AWS Certified Solutions Architect at an Associate level during the course of this project.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I also developed a Web Scraping and multithreading-based low latency REST app with high scalability over API Gateway and messaging queues to improve online KYC times by 60%. We delivered this project in a record time of 3 months, and this was the first time working on something as an individual contributor. This project remains one of my favorites to date.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I also voluntarily took up the task to convert a Python 2 codebase of 26,500 lines to Python 3 while improving test coverage from about 64% to 95%. We did this conversion because AWS was removing Python 2 support for Lambda. Here I understood the philosophical decisions of our backend at the company level, and I even suggested optimizations for a few services along the way.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        In my current Software Engineer 2 role at PayPal, I am building the core platform for Automated Role Provisioning, with orchestrated microservice endpoints acting as the entry point for all auth requests on the platform. This initiative is completely based on Java and Node.js, and I've been coding in both for more than a year now.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I have also developed and reviewed the codebase for a critical Spring Boot app, reducing API latency by 43% in a month. That was done in tight sync with the frontend development team to get ideas on which APIs needed improvement on priority and other discussions around caching, load balancing, and lazy loading.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Apart from these development activities, I have created a real-time Monitoring and Alerting engine using Splunk & SignalFx over existing logging infrastructure. That gave me a great insight into what it takes to not just develop but also maintain the availability of high-traffic server-side components.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I also communicated with the Observability team to introduce PagerDuty-based alerts integration for Identity components, cutting response time for severe alerts and production issues by almost half for critical services. I have been on-call a few times now, and I have a much better understanding of the security playbooks, downtime mitigation policies, and data protection measures that tech companies use at a large scale.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        And finally, like a responsible Software Engineer I am, I improved unit test coverage for a Java-based Microservices project from 77% to 98% using JUnit and Mockito. I found a few bugs in the business logic along the way, and reading the code by others increased my understanding of the broader architecture at PayPal almost twofold, making me one of the go-to guys for backend.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I have worked with several full-stack technologies in and out over the past 4 years, and mentored a couple of junior engineers, being an SDE 2 myself. All this while having hobbies like traveling across India and making music on the side. If you are looking for a creative, disciplined, and overall optimistic person seasoned in the Fintech domain to be a part of Collctiv, I am your guy.
